# Face-Anti-Spoofing
- A simple face anti-spoofing system to judge whether a face is real or fake.<br />
- The system classifies the faces as real or fake based on the model that is trained with publicly available dataset.<br />
- The model was built using [Resnet 50 V2 feature vector](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v2_50/feature_vector/5).<br />
Check the github repository here: [Face Anti-Spoofing](https://github.com/kalpitborkar/Face-Anti-Spoofing-System)
